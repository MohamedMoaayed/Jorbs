### Tech

Jorbs app uses several open-source projects to work properly and efficiently:

* [Flutter] - Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for Cross platforms
* [BLoC] - a predictable state management library for Dart. Bloc architecture allows us to test and develop our application more easily and more scalable.
